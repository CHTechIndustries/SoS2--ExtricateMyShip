	<description>Ever wished you could get colonists without needing, you know, colonists?
Ever wished you could use Save our Ship 2 without haveing to worry about carrying uranium?
Ever wished you could have Cannons and such, but not have to manually fill them?
Ever wished for antimatter weapons?
Ever wished for an enemy that could actually destroy you?
Ever wished to start as an archotech?
Ever wished to start with a super weapon?

if you said yes to any of those, here you are! This mod adds at least some of that, and all those are planned, as is more. So much more...

Okay, now, time for a fun fact: This mods name is a play on the name of the mod it's adding onto!
You see, Extricate has a similar meaning to Save, and it might be our ship, but you made it, so it is also your (or, from your perspective, my) ship. So, the name is made of related words for the mod it's adding to!

P.S. thank you to Kentington for Save our Ship 2, and Primarch XVI for {redacted} p {redacted} use {redacted}. So, now you know the meaning of life!
